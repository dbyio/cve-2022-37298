# CVE-2022-37298: RCE in Shinken Monitoring 

**Versions Affected** 2.4.3 (possibly prior)  
**Disclosure Link:** https://github.com/naparuba/shinken/commit/2dae40fd1e713aec9e1966a0ab7a580b9180cff2
  
## Description

The SafeUnpickler class found in shinken/safepickle.py implements a weak authentication scheme when unserializing objects supposedly passed from legitimate monitoring nodes to the Shinken server. An attacker can send a crafted pickle object instantiating one of the internal, implicitly trusted Shinken object, some of which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the monitoring server.

### Usage
